In the realm of financial services, accurately predicting loan defaults is critical for mitigating risks and optimizing lending strategies. This project undertakes a comparative analysis of three machine learning models—Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees—aimed at predicting loan defaults based on various borrower characteristics. Through rigorous evaluation using the ROC-AUC metric, the Linear Regression model emerged as the most effective, achieving an impressive AUC score of 0.9879, indicating a 98.79% accuracy in its predictions. While both KNN and Decision Trees provided valuable insights with AUC scores of 0.9 and 0.9516, respectively, the results highlight the importance of selecting the right model for accurate risk assessment in lending. This analysis not only emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of each model but also aims to inform financial institutions in their decision-making processes regarding loan approvals and risk management strategies.
